#Implementation of a sketch of a file system using C.

There is simple functionality here like creating and deleting a node.

The inode structure contains metadata about files and directories, including pointers to other inodes in the file system. In this way, a tree with one root node is formed.

A makefile and several test files are included here. Test files are not created by me.

I am not the only contributor to this code.
